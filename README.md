In this extended project, we successfully applied unsupervised machine learning to perform customer segmentation.


1.  **Performed an in-depth EDA:** Used 2D and 3D plots to explore customer data from multiple angles.
2.  **Built two distinct segmentation models:** Created an income-based model and an age-based model, showing that segmentation is not a one-size-fits-all process.
3.  **Used the Elbow Method** to programmatically determine the optimal number of clusters for each scenario.
4.  **Introduced Hierarchical Clustering** as an alternative method and used its dendrogram to validate our choice of `k`.
5.  **Created quantitative, data-driven personas** for each segment, providing the marketing team with precise, actionable insights for targeted campaigns.

This project highlights how different clustering approaches can uncover different facets of customer behavior, providing a richer, more nuanced understanding than a single model alone.
